Components are distinguished here because these files don't necessarily use any entities,
or they may contain several ones.  Entities and scripts rely on them - in contrast, entities do not
rely on each other, relying on actions, the stage, collision flags etc etc to interact.

Practically, if entities want to "know" about each other's prototypes, that should be a separate file
laid on top of the parties, and the loader for that file should be localized in the chapter loader.

Here's how to regard each:
Components are "common but optional to builds",
entities are "isolated",
and the other code on top (high level script) is "special".

A big reason for this is the ability to load and test bits and pieces interactively.
