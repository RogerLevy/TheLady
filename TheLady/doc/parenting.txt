\ parenting works differently than Flash
\  parenting does "cascade" certain properties - visibility, enabled
\    this is done by using separate code paths for actors that are children (have parents)
\  but it doesn't control priority - objects are rendered in the normal order
\  transformations can be inherited but it's not mandatory
\  in this way objects can be "grouped" without being attached to each other (leaving
\  the possibility for manual or physics-based attachment), or you can attach them using the engine
\  such that hitbox fetches and entity display follow the parent's transform info recursively...
\    so it's a bit slow, but it's more flexible.
