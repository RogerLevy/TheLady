integrate layout editor
   UI for manipulating display transforms
      scale, tint, rotation
   edit prototypes visually
      priority
      Z
      display transform

heirearchical object tree
   viewport
      camera
         game
         UI stuff

   the principle here is a simple flexible system that solves a domain of similar problems


integrated prompt

all entities should be actors?

automated data importing
   automatic ANIMATION creation from SCML files 


more vtables for example one that includes words like:
   PLAY STOP REWIND SEEK PLAYHEAD SPEED! SPEED@
   


start over in certain areas
   entities
      more abstraction, less direct access
      access to DSPT should be more transparent
      reduce the need to think about things
   actors
      might be combined into entities anyway
      some utilities should be simpler to use
      
   engine
   deployment


strengths that made previous systems easier to use

   more thoughtfulness
      example - sound handles
         a special VALUE could automatically set SND
         it could be a special VALUE-style field, transparently.


which allof etc -> more generalized (for things other than actors)

improve how layouts work - like multiple layouts, how does that work (ability to select which one to save? save all of them?)

more advanced sound management - like sounds that persist
   and are multiple streams possible?!?!
   
selecting all of a parent type including those of its descendents
