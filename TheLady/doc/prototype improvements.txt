more convenient prototype development and testing


arsenal:

pstruct
~>
fields
var and friends
endp
s! => ->
be { ( } )
reopen


things we might want to do

change words
   
change vtables
   

change vars of instances
   s!
   {
   (etc.)

change the prototype and make new instances
   replace another instance so there's only one
   replace all other instances on the stage???

create, manipulate and test multiple stages
